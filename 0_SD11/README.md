# Software Design Quarter 1 Year 1
This course was an introductory course to `C++` programming.
For background the book Fundamentals of C++ was used: http://python.cs.southern.edu/cppbook/progcpp.pdf


## Week 1 - The Basics
### Assignment 1.1: Hello Application
Write a console application, which shows, for instance, your name, your country and some more information about you.
Note: you do not need to ask for the information before displaying it.

**Goal:**: Learn basic syntax and how to write to an output stream.

### Assignment 1.2: My Age
Write a C++ program using a variable to store the age of a person. The output of the program could look like the example below: 
I am 20 years old.

**Goal:**: Understand variables, specifically strings.
### Assignment 1.3: My Data
Write a C++ program to prompt a user to input his/her age, height and weight, and then the output will be shown as in the example below:

`Your name is Arjan, your age is 25, and your pin is 9000`

**Goal:**: Learn how to read user input.
### Assignment 1.4: My Initials
Write a C++ program which shows your initials. For example, if your name would be Mary Poppins, then the output of the program would look like: `M.P.`
- Implement this program for your own set of initials.

**Goal:**: Learn about data handling in relation to strings.
### Assignment 1.5: Code debugging
Suppose x, y, and z are int variables and x = 2, y = 5 and z = 6. What is the output of each of the following statements?
- `cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << ", z = " << z << '\n';`
- `cout << "x + y = " << x + y << '\n';`
- `cout << "Sum of " << x << " and " << z << " is " << x + z << '\n';`
- `cout << "z / x = " << z / x << '\n';`
- `cout << "2 times " << x << " = " << 2 * x << '\n';`

For each statement, first think of what will be printed to the screen. After that verify your answer by putting the statement into the main function of a program (that also assigns the values to x, y and z).

**Goal:** Understand integer mathematics.

### Assignment 1.6: Exchange the content of 2 variables
Write a C/C++ program to exchange the content of two integer variables (x and y).
The program first reads the initial values of x and y. 
Then your code must swap the content of the 2 variables and at the end the program should display the new values of both x and y. 
Think about the design of your code first, before you implement!

No cheating allowed: you must really swap the content of the variables!

**Goal:**: Understand data handling.

### Assignment 1.7: Code implementation
Consider the following program segment
```
//include statement(s)

int main()
{
    //variable declaration
    
    //executable statements
    
    //return statement
    
}
```
- Write C++ statements that include the iostream header.
- Write a C++ statement that allows you to use cin and cout without the prefix std::.
- Write C++ statements that declare the variables: num1, num2, num3 and average of type int.
- Write C++ statements that store 125 into num1, 28 into num2, and -25 into num3.
- Write a C++ statement that calculates the average of num1, num2 and num3, and stores this into
- rage.
- Write C++ statements that output the values of num1, num2, num3, and average.
- Compile and run your program.

**Goal:** Get used to creating your own C++ code.

## Week 2 - Growing project complexity and floating point values
### Assignment 2.1: Circle calculations (modified exercise 4.24 from the
book)
Write a program that asks the user to enter the radius of a circle as an integer value. 
Your program should display the circle‚Äôs diameter, circumference and area using the floating-point value 3.14159 for œÄ. 
Hint: Remember to use a named constant for œÄ (of type double).
Given the radius (r) that the user enters, use the following formulas:
- diameter = 2*r
- circumference = 2*r*œÄ
- area = œÄ*r*r

**Goal:** Introduction to float and double variables

### Assignment 2.2: Total earned EC for all SD courses
Write a C++ program to calculate the total earned EC‚Äôs for SD courses for one Engineering student. 
In total, there are four SD courses in the first year: SD11, SD12, SD21 and SD22. 
For each of them a student can earn either 1.5 EC (passed) or 0 EC (failed). 
Ask the user to enter the number of earned EC‚Äôs (0 or 1.5) for each of the four SD courses, and calculate and show the total of earned EC‚Äôs. 
Draw a flowchart for this application.

**Goal:** Get familiar with drawing flowcharts before diving into programming

### Assignment 2.3: Midpoints (Exercise 4.25 from the book)
In mathematics, the midpoint between the two points (ùíôùüè, ùíöùüè) and (ùíôùüê, ùíöùüê) is computed by the
formula
((x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2)
Write a C++ program that asks for two mathematical points from the user and computes and computes and displays their midpoint.
The user literally enters ‚Äù(0,0)‚Äù and ‚Äù(1,1)‚Äù with the parentheses and commas. 
To see how to do this, suppose you want to allow a user to enter the point (2.3,9), assigning the x component of the point to a variable named x and the y component to a variable named y. 
You can add the following code fragment to your program to achieve the desired effect:
```
double x, y;
char leftParen, comma, rightParen;
cin >> leftParen >> x >> comma >> y >> rightParen;
```
If the user literally types (2.3,9), the cin statement will assign the ( character to the variable
leftParen. It will then assign 2.3 to the variable x. 
It assigns the , character to the variable named comma, the value 9 to the y variable, and the ) character to the rightParen variable.
The leftParen, comma, and rightParen variables are just placeholders for the user‚Äôs input and are not used elsewhere within the program. 
In reality, the user can type in other characters in place of the parentheses and comma as long as the numbers are in the proper location relative to the characters; for example, the user could enter *2.3:9#, and the program would still interpret this as the point (2.3,9). We‚Äôll learn ways to prevent this later in the course.

**Goal:** Learn about more complex user inputs

### Assignment 2.4: Calories of food (Exercise 4.26 from the book)
The table below lists the Calorie contents of several types of food. 
| Food | Calories |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bean Burrito | 357 |
| Salad w/ Dressing | 187 |
| Milkshake | 388 |

Running or walking burns approx. 100 Calories per mile. 
Write a C++ program that requests three values from the user: the number of bean burritos, salads, and shakes consumed (in that order). 
The program should then display the number of miles that must be run or walked to burn off the Calories in the amount of food the user had.
Observe that the result is a floating-point value, so you should use floating-point arithmetic to compute the answers for this problem.

**Goal:** Get more experience with floating point calculations

### Assignment 2.5: Minimize the coins
Write a program that first asks the user for two (positive) integer values. 
The first one is the number of euros, the second one is the number of cents.
The program must determine a set of coins with a value equal to the value of the amount
entered, with the restriction that the number of coins must be minimized!
First think about how you solve this problem and only then start implementing!
You must display the amount of coins at the end. Two possible results of your program are
displayed below. What is the difference between these two examples?
Optional: could you change your program such that the total amount of money is read in a single line, similar to the method that we used in Assignment 2.3?

**Goal:** Get used to more complex code

## Week 3 - Basic data analysis
### Assignment 3.1 Odd or even
A program asks the user to enter one integer, and then determines and displays whether the number is odd or even.
Use the remainder operator: an even number is dividable by 2, so any multiple of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.

**Goal:** Understand basic operations and conditional logic.

### Assignment 3.2: Comparing three integers
A program asks the user to enter three integer values (e.g. 56, 30 and 45).
Your program should compare these three integers, and display the value of the largest 
(e.g. ‚ÄúThe maximum value is 56.‚Äù).
If all three numbers are equal, the program should display the message ‚ÄúAll numbers are equal.‚Äù.
Again, first create the flow chart of the program and then implement the code!

**Goal:** Practice using conditional statements and comparisons.


### Assignment 3.3: Duplicates (Exercise 5.20 from the book)
A program requests three integer values from the user.
It then displays one of two things: if any of the values entered are duplicates, it displays ‚ÄúDUPLICATES‚Äù; otherwise, it displays ‚ÄúALL UNIQUE‚Äù.
First Create the flow chart of the program and then implement the code.

**Goal:** Practice checking for duplicates and logical conditions.


### Assignment 3.4: Arithmetic with 2 numbers
The goal is to write a program that performs some arithmetic on any pair of numbers with the choice of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing the first number by the second one.
First ask the user for two numbers and next ask for one of the operators +, ‚àí, * or /.
Depending on the operator the user enters, compute and display the result of the operation.

**Goal:** Practice using operators and user input for operations.

## Week 4 - Introduction to more complex program structures
### Assignment 4.1: Body mass index
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated based on the following formula:
```
BMI = weight / (height^2) 
```
Design and write a program that asks the user to enter the weight and height. 
Your program should calculate and display the BMI. 
Also show the following explanation so that the user can evaluate his/her BMI:
| Type | Range |
|------|-------|
|Underweight | less than 18.5 |
|Normal | between 18.5 and 24.9 |
|Overweight | between 25 and 29.9 |
|Obese | 30 or greater |

If the BMI value indicates the person is obese, issue the following warning ‚ÄúYour BMI is extremely high.
Please contact your doctor because your health is in danger!‚Äù.

**Goal:** Practice input/output, mathematical operations, and conditional checks to calculate and interpret BMI

### Assignment 4.2: Body fat of a person
Another way to determine how healthy someone is, is by measuring his/her body fat percentage.
The formulas to determine the body fat for female and male are as follows:
Body fat formula for women:
```
A1 = (body weight x 0.732) + 8.987
A2 = wrist measurement (at fullest point) / 3.140
A3 = waist measurement (at naval) x 0.157
A4 = hip measurement (at fullest point) x 0.249
A5 = forearm measurement (at fullest point) x 0.434
B = A1 + A2 ‚Äì A3 ‚Äì A4 + A5
Body fat = body weight ‚Äì B
Body fat percentage = body fat x 100 / body weight
```
Body fat formula for men:
```
A1 = (body weight x 1.082) + 94.42
A2 = waist measurement x 4.15
B = A1 ‚Äì A2
Body fat = body weight ‚Äì B
Body fat percentage = body fat x 100 / body weight
Note: weights in pounds, measurements in inches.
```
Design and write a program to calculate the body fat of a person.

**Goal:** Using multiple variables, scientific notation for unit conversions, and conditional logic.

### Assignment 4.3: Body fat of a person
Extend assignment 4.2 such that two arbitrary persons can compare their body fat such that the program determines who has the least body fat.

**Goal:** Organizing code with functions or data structures to compare results.

### Assignment 4.4: Days of the month
Design and implement a program that asks the user to enter a month (1 for January, 2 for February,and so on) and then prints the number of days in the month. For February, print ‚Äú28 or 29 days‚Äù.
Do not use a separate if/else branch for each month!

**Goal:** Using arrays or switch-case to avoid repetitive if-else logic

### Assignment 4.5: Wavelengths
Design and write a program that prompts the user for a wavelength value and prints a description of the
corresponding part of the electromagnetic spectrum, as given in the table below.
Type Wavelength (m) Frequency (Hz)

| Type | Wavelength (m) | Frequency (Hz) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Radio Waves   | > 10^-1                | < 3 x 10^9 |
| Microwave     | 10^-3 to 10^-1         | 3 x 10^9 to 3 x 10^11 |
| Infrared      | 7 x 10^-7 to 10^-3     | 3 x 10^11 to 4 x 10^14 |
| Visible light | 4 x 10^-7 to 7 x 10^-7 | 4 x 10^14 to 7.5 x 10^14 |
| Ultraviolet   | 10^-8 to 4 x 10^-7     | 7.5 x 10^14 to 3 x 10^16 |
| X-rays        | 10^-11 to 10^-8        | 3 x 10^16 to 3 x 10^19 |
| Gamma rays    | < 10^-11               | > 3 x 10^19 |


Hint: you can make use of scientific notation also in C++, saving you a lot of counting and typing zeroes

for this exercise. Have a look at Chapter 3 from the book to figure out how to do this!

**Goal:** Using floating-point arithmetic with scientific notation, comparison operators, and constants to categorize data into predefined ranges

## Week 5 - More on Loop Structures and Data Processing in C++

### Assignment 5.1: Tabular output
Consider a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should then print a table like the one shown below (in this example, the user has entered value 20).
- What kind of repetition will you use and why?
- Create the flow chart of the program.
- Write the program.

Hint: use the tab escape sequence \t to format the output. For example, the string `N\tN*N\tN*N*N\tN*N*N*N` will display the header of the table shown below.

|N|N^2|N^3|N^4|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|1|1|1|1|
|2| 4| 8| 16|
|3| 9| 27| 81|
|‚Ä¶|‚Ä¶|‚Ä¶|‚Ä¶|
|20| 400| 8000| 160000|

**Goal:** Using for loops to generate rows and arithmetic operations to calculate powers.

### Assignment 5.2: Sum of integers
Consider a program that asks the user for an integer value greater than 10, say 15. The
program should then calculate the sum of all positive values up to 15: `1 + 2 + 3 + ‚Ä¶ + 15`.
- What kind of repetition will you use and why?
- Create the flow chart of the program.
- Write the program.

**Goal:** Using for loops to accumulate sums, understanding loop variables, and practicing basic arithmetic.

### Assignment 5.3: Advanced Sum of integers (extension of assignment 5.2)
Adjust the flow chart and the program you wrote for assignment 5.2 in order to show the current sum after adding each number, so the mathematical steps taken per addition. 

**Goal:** Using loop variables to track partial sums, printing intermediate results, and refining loop control for clarity.

### Assignment 5.4: Reverse sum of integers
Consider a program that asks the user for an integer value greater than 15, say 45. 
The program should then calculate the int value n for which it holds that:

1 + 2 + 3 + ‚Ä¶ + (n ‚àí 1) + n < 45

and

1 + 2 + 3 + ‚Ä¶ + (n ‚àí 1) + n + (n + 1) >= 45

A possible result of your program could be something like:

- What kind of repetition will you use and why?
- Create the flow chart of the program.
- Write the program.

**Goal:** Using while loops with conditional checks to find the correct sum threshold, practicing loop exit conditions, and handling dynamic input.

## Week 6 - Control Structures, Data Manipulation, and Algorithm Implementation

### Assignment 6.1: Limited minimum and maximum
The algorithm for finding the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) number is often used in programming.
For example, a program that determines the winner and loser of a sales competition would input the number of products sold by each sales person.
The person who sold the largest number of products wins the competition.
The person who sold the smallest number of products loses the competition.
The program should ask the user to input the amount of sold products of 3 sales agents.
Next, the program should show which amount is the largest and which is the smallest.
- Create the flow chart of this program.
- Implement this program.
Adjust the program you made in such a way that the user can enter as many sales agents as he/she wants.
The user should indicate that all sales agents have been processed by entering a
negative number.
A possible result of your program could be something like:
- What kind of repetition structure would you use? Explain why?
- Create the flow chart of this extended program.
- Implement the code.

Optional: extend the program even further, such that not only the number of products sold is shown for the winner and loser, but also the number of the sales agent who is the winner and the number of the sales agent who is the loser.
So for example:
```
Sales agent 2 is the loser and sold 4 products!
Sales agent 4 is the winner and sold 15 products!
```
If the same number of sold products is entered for two sales agents, you can choose which one is the winner (you don‚Äôt need to take special care for this in your program).

**Goal:** Using while loops to process dynamic user input, comparing values to track min/max, and optionally storing agent data in arrays/vectors

### Assignment 6.2: Number Pi
The German mathematician Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716) discovered the rather remarkable fact that the mathematical constant œÄ can be computed using the following mathematical relationship:
```
pi()/4 = 1 ‚àí 1/3 + 1/5 ‚àí 1/7 + 1/9 ‚àí 1/11 //etc
```

The formula to the right of the equal sign represents an infinite series; each fraction represents a term in that series.
If you start with 1, subtract one-third, add one-fifth, and so on, for each of the odd integers, you get a number that gets closer and closer to the value of ùúã/4 as you go along.
Design and write a program that calculates an approximation of ùúã consisting of the first 10,000 terms in Leibniz‚Äô series.

**Goal:** Implement a mathematical series using loops and floating-point arithmetic.

### Assignment 6.3: Predator ‚Äì prey
In a predator-prey simulation, you compute the populations of predators and prey, using the following equations:
```
prey[n+1] = prey[n] * (1 + A ‚àí B * pred[n]);
pred[n+1] = pred[n] * (1 ‚àí C + D * prey[n]);
```
Here, A is the rate at which prey birth exceeds natural death, B is the rate of predation, C is the rate at which predator deaths exceed births without food, and D represents predator increase in the presence of food.
We will write a program that prompts users for these rates, the initial population sizes, and the number of periods the simulation should run.
Then it should print the populations for the given number of periods.

As inputs, try A = 0.1, B = C = 0.01, and D = 0.00002 with initial prey and predator populations of 1,000 and 20.

- What kind of repetition structure would you use? Explain why?
- Create the flow chart of this program.
- Implement the code.

**Goal:** Simulate dynamic population growth using mathematical equations and loops.

### Assignment 6.4: Number guessing game
We are going to make a game where the user has to guess a (random) number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100.
As we did not yet discuss random number generation, you may have your ‚Äúrandom‚Äù number hardcoded in the declaration of the variable (use const int).
Your program should now ask the user to guess the number.
If the user guesses the number correctly, the program should show ‚ÄúCorrect!‚Äù.
Otherwise, the program should check whether the guessed number is lower or higher than the random number:

If the guessed number is less than the random number, the program outputs ```Higher!```
If the guessed number is greater than the random number, the program outputs ```Lower!```
After that, the program should ask the user for his/her next guess.
This should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

- What kind of repetition structure would you use? Explain why!
- Create the flow chart of this program.
- Implement the code.

Now we are going to extend our program in two steps:

Extension 1: In the program you implemented, the user is given as many tries as needed to guess the correct number.
Redesign the program so that the user has no more than five tries to guess the correct number.
At the end, your program should display an appropriate message, such as ```You win!``` or ```You lose!```

Extension 2: In the current program, if the guessed number is not correct, the program only tells you to guess lower or higher.
We are now going to modify our program to give you a bit more help.
Introduce a new variable int diff, and after each guess calculate the difference between the user‚Äôs guess and your random number.
Suppose your random number is stored in a variable named num and the user‚Äôs guess is stored in a variable named guess, the absolute value of the difference can be calculated as:
```diff = abs(num ‚Äì guess);```
In order for this to work, you need to include the ```cstdlib``` library in your code.

Now, if diff is equal to 0, the user guessed the number correctly and wins the game (as before).

If diff is not equal to 0, the program outputs a message as follows:
- If diff ‚â• 50, the program displays ```Much, much higher!``` or ```Much, much lower!```
- If 30 ‚â§ diff < 50, the program displays ```Much higher!``` or ```Much lower!```
- If 10 ‚â§ diff < 30, the program displays ```Higher!``` or ```Lower!```
- If 0 < diff < 10, the program displays ```Slightly higher!``` or ```Slightly lower!```
As in the previous version of your program, the user should get five tries to guess the number.

**Goal:** Learning about control flow structures, conditional logic, and data manipulation, as a collection of all that was learned before.
