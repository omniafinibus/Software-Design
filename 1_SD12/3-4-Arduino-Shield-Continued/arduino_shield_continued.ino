A)	Because when you use delay() it freezes the program.
	Which isn't a problem when everything is done sequentially
	But it is when it is looped, because it causes unnessecary delays
	and or timer problems

B)	Because of delay() it will only check for a different value
	of the potmeter every "Valspeed" and not every loop.
