# Embedded Systems and Software Design – Bachelor's Project Portfolio
This portfolio provides an overview of all software design assignments and projects completed during my Bachelor's degree, with a focus on embedded systems, C/C++ software development, and hardware-software integration. The work spans from foundational programming and microcontroller interfacing to advanced topics such as real-time systems, networking, and robotics.

Each section listed below represents a quarter of either year 1 or 2. It show a progression of learning the skills required to design, build, and debug complete embedded systems—from blinking LEDs to building a Bluetooth-controlled walking robot.

* Basic syntax, I/O, variables, data types
* User input and debugging
* Arithmetic and conditional logic
* Flowcharts and problem-solving
* Loops and repetition
* Simple data processing
* Intro to scientific notation and categorization
* Gradual progression in complexity across weekly assignments

### **SD12 - Software Design 2 (Arduino + C++)**

Hands-on embedded programming using Arduino:

* Digital input/output (LEDs, buttons)
* Timing and delays (including blinking without delay)
* Debouncing techniques
* Modularization of code using header/source files
* Intro to trigonometry and analog input with potentiometers
* Reusability and code structure improvements
* Basic arithmetic and body fat calculators

---

### **SD13 - Software Design 3 (Data Structures & Statistics)**

Focus on arrays and pointers in C++:

* Generating and analyzing numeric sequences

* Implementing finite state machines (e.g., Knight Rider pattern)
* PWM control of RGB LEDs for smooth color transitions
* Analog input sampling (ADC) and voltage display on LCD
* Emphasis on timing control, signal conditioning, and code organization

---

### **ES22 – Embedded Systems 2 (Interrupts, Clocks & Alarms)**

Advanced control using interrupts and modular design:

* Transition to event-driven programming (Knight Rider via ISRs)
* Real-time digital clock with time setting and alarm modes
* Integration of RGB LED patterns and audio effects for alarm output
* Modular architecture supporting code reusability and maintainability
